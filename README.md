# MomentsInHistory 🕰️

**MomentsInHistory** is an automated, AI-powered application that generates and posts historical event content (both text and images) to Facebook. 

Leveraging the power of **Amazon Bedrock** foundation models, the system uses advanced AI to craft engaging historical narratives and generate accompanying visuals dynamically. The application is fully serverless, running on **AWS Lambda** with the latest Python runtime, and is orchestrated using **AWS EventBridge** for scheduled, hands-free execution. Upon successful completion of each posting cycle, it sends an email notification using **AWS SNS**. All infrastructure components are provisioned and managed using **Terraform** for streamlined deployment and infrastructure consistency. Deployment and CI/CD workflows are automated via **GitHub Actions**, ensuring seamless and repeatable releases.
